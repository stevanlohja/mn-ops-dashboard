 * Nighthawk product roadmap — hand-maintained directional workstreams.

 * This is a *product* roadmap for the dashboard itself: intentions, not dated
 * commitments. It is deliberately not telemetry and not a calendar (see the
 * OUT-of-scope guardrails in ../project-purpose.md) — nothing here is measured,
 * projected, or dated. Keep statuses honest: flip an item to "in-flight" only
 * when work has actually started.
