/**
 * First-visit product tour — pure data, no React.
 *
 * Each step optionally spotlights a DOM element matched by `target` (a CSS
 * selector against a `data-tour="…"` anchor). Steps with no `target` render as
 * a centered card (welcome / sign-off). The overlay that consumes these lives
 * in `components/tour/TourOverlay.tsx`; anchors are set in the nav.
 *
 * Bump the version suffix on STORAGE_KEY when the tour changes materially so
 * returning users are re-shown the updated walkthrough.
