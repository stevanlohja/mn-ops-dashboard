# PO Dash 2.0 — Midnight Network Operations Dashboard

Internal dashboard for monitoring Midnight Network health and FNO validators. Version 2.0 is a ground-up rework of the `po_dash_0.1` prototype with four headline additions: **validator attestation tracking**, **report generation**, **Discord webhook alerting**, and **dark/light theming** — on a modular architecture with strict separation of concerns.

Data source: the public Substrate telemetry feed at `wss://telemetry.shielded.tools/feed/` (Mainnet, Preprod, Preview). Everything runs client-side in the browser; there is no backend, database, or API key.

---

## Run locally

Requires Node.js 20+ (tested on 22) and pnpm (npm/yarn also work).

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev        # development server → http://localhost:3000
```

Production build:

```bash
pnpm build
pnpm start      # serves the optimized build → http://localhost:3000
pnpm lint       # eslint
```

The app is a Next.js App Router project with no server-side state — it deploys as-is to any serverless host (Vercel, Netlify, Cloudflare) or any box that can run `next start`.

## Pages

| Route | What it does |
|-------|--------------|
| `/dashboard` | Real-time network health: best/finalized block, finality gap, block time, alerts with runbook links, and per-node tables (validators, gateways, boot nodes) with a detail drawer. |
| `/attestation` | Per-validator attestation: block authorship counts and share vs the expected round-robin share, finality lag, block propagation, uptime, connection flaps, and a composite 0–100 score. Includes a live feed of recently authored blocks. |
| `/reports` | Report builder: snapshot the current network state into Markdown, **plain text (Notifi-safe)**, JSON, or CSV. Toggle sections, then copy to clipboard, download, or print. |
| `/diagnostic` | Guided incident diagnostic tree (carried over from v0.1). |
| `/runbooks` | Runbook index + rendered runbook pages (wired up in 2.0 — these were dead stubs in v0.1). |
| `/docs` | Operator documentation mirrored from the `midnight-network-ops` MkDocs site (FNO guides, architecture, processes, ADRs, FAQ), rendered natively in the dashboard theme. See [Documentation](#documentation). |
| `/network-change` | *Experimental*, manually-maintained status board of coordinated changes (Cardano/Midnight HFs, node releases, host migrations) as they roll Preview → Preprod → Mainnet, with live telemetry-derived rollout readiness where measurable. |
| `/roadmap` | *Experimental* planning calendar. A month grid renders multi-day windows as highlighted spanning bars, with an Agenda list view; events are the Network-Change board projected automatically plus a hand-editable events file. Manually maintained, forward-looking — not telemetry. |

Theme toggle (dark/light) lives in the nav. Dark is the brand default; the choice persists in `localStorage` and respects the OS preference until you choose explicitly.

## Discord alerts

The bell icon in the nav configures push alerting to a Discord channel via webhook — no backend needed (Discord's webhook endpoint accepts browser POSTs directly). Paste a webhook URL (`https://discord.com/api/webhooks/<id>/<token>`), pick a trigger level, optionally add a role mention (`<@&role-id>`), and enable. Config persists in `localStorage`; alerting runs on every page since the watcher is mounted in the root layout.

Two trigger levels:

| Level | Fires on |
|-------|----------|
| **Consensus failures only** (default) | Validators below GRANDPA 2/3 (< 9), finality gap ≥ 7 blocks, avg block time > 30s, validator isolated (0 peers) |
| **Degradation + consensus failures** | Also validators at the finality floor, low peer counts, block time > 10s, finality gap ≥ 4 |

Delivery behavior (edge-triggered, in `lib/notify/engine.ts`):

- A new or escalated alert posts immediately (throttled to one evaluation per 5s).
- Still-active **critical** alerts re-post every 15 minutes; warnings post once until resolved.
- Recoveries post a green "resolved" embed.
- Alerting arms 30s after the feed goes live (and re-arms on reconnect/network switch) so bootstrap noise — e.g. "2/13 validators online" while the node list is still filling in — never pages anyone.
- Role/user mentions are only allowed when explicitly typed into the mention field; alert text itself can never ping.

### A note on attestation methodology

Telemetry does not expose signed block authorship, so the dashboard attributes a block to the **first node that reports a new height** on the feed. That is an observability heuristic — good for spotting validators that have silently stopped producing — not a cryptographic proof. Scores accumulate per dashboard session and reset on reload or network switch. The caveat is embedded in generated reports too.

The attestation score is a weighted composite (re-normalised when a component lacks data):

| Component | Weight | Signal |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| Presence | 0.35 | online + feed freshness, minus reconnect flaps |
| Authorship | 0.25 | observed share vs expected `1/n` round-robin share |
| Finality | 0.25 | node finalized height vs network finalized head |
| Peer health | 0.15 | peer count vs the network's expected peer target |

## Documentation

The `/docs` section embeds the operator documentation that lives in the `midnight-network-ops` repo (a MkDocs Material site) directly inside the dashboard, rendered in the dashboard's own theme rather than as a separate site — so there is no second look-and-feel to maintain.

Content is **vendored**, not built from a second tool. A sync script reads the read-only ops clone and regenerates everything:

```bash
pnpm docs:sync        # re-run whenever the ops-repo docs change
```

It does three things (`scripts/sync-docs.mjs`):

1. Copies `git/midnight-network-ops/docs/**/*.md` into `content/docs/` (the ops clone is read-only; the script only reads it).
2. Parses the `nav:` in `mkdocs.yml` into `lib/docs/manifest.ts` (sidebar tree) and generates `lib/docs/loader.ts` (static MDX import registry).
3. Rewrites two pieces of MkDocs-specific syntax so the content renders as plain markdown in the dashboard:
   - admonitions (`!!! note "Title"`) → `remark-directive` containers, styled as `.admonition` blocks via `app/globals.css`;
   - inter-doc links (`](install-node-and-keys.md)`) → dashboard routes (`/docs/...`).

Mermaid diagrams stay as fenced blocks and render client-side via `components/docs/Mermaid.tsx` (wired through a `pre` override in `mdx-components.tsx`), theme-aware with the rest of the dashboard.

`content/docs/`, `lib/docs/manifest.ts`, and `lib/docs/loader.ts` are generated — do not edit them by hand; change the source in the ops repo and re-run `pnpm docs:sync`.

## Architecture

Separation of concerns is the organizing rule: **`lib/` is pure TypeScript with zero React imports** (unit-testable in isolation), `providers/` binds that logic to React, `components/` renders it, `app/` only routes.

```

Key design decisions vs v0.1:

- **Reducer store.** v0.1 called `setState` once per feed event (a busy message could trigger dozens of renders). 2.0 parses each WebSocket message into an event batch and applies it in a single pure reducer transition — one render per message, and all attestation bookkeeping lives in `lib/state/telemetry-reducer.ts` where it can be tested without a browser.
- **Attestation keyed by node name.** Telemetry ids are reassigned on reconnect; names are stable. Records survive validator restarts, which is what makes session/disconnect counting possible.
- **Reports are a frozen model.** `buildReport()` snapshots live state into a serialisable `ReportModel`; renderers never touch live state, so every export format is a pure function of the same snapshot.
- **Theming via CSS variables.** Components only reference `mn-*` Tailwind tokens, which resolve through `data-theme`-scoped CSS variables — every component (including code carried over from v0.1) is theme-aware with no per-component work. An inline head script applies the persisted theme before first paint (no flash).
- **Thresholds parameterised per network.** Expected validator count (13) and peer target (17) live in `lib/telemetry/networks.ts` instead of being hardcoded through the UI.

## Operational thresholds

| Check | Warning | Critical |
|-------|---------|----------|
| Validators online (network-aware; finality floor = `floor(2N/3)+1`, e.g. 9 of 13) | at the floor (one fault from a stall, e.g. 9/13) | below the floor (below GRANDPA 2/3 — finality at risk, e.g. < 9/13) |
| Finality gap | ≥ 4 blocks | ≥ 7 blocks |
| Avg block time | > 10s | > 30s |
| Validator peers (mainnet, 17 expected) | below target | 0 (isolated) |

The validator-count check is **network-aware**: it derives from each network's expected federated set in `lib/telemetry/networks.ts` and the GRANDPA 2/3 finality floor — so a healthy federated set with spare margin (e.g. 13/13 or 10/13) is not flagged "reduced resilience." Networks with no fixed set (testnets, `expectedValidators: null`) are not count-judged; a genuine stall still surfaces via the finality-gap check. Alerts deep-link to the matching runbook under `/runbooks`.
